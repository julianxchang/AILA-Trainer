The title company mentioned there's an old lien on the property from a contractor in 2015. Can you explain how this might impact the closing and whether the seller is responsible for clearing it before we move forward?

During the final walkthrough today, we noticed that the seller removed the dining room chandelier, which was supposed to be included per the purchase agreement. How should we address this before closing tomorrow?

My lender just informed me that final underwriting on my mortgage for 19 Willow Lane, Lexington, MA 02420 may take an extra week. The financing contingency deadline in the purchase agreement is coming up in three days.
Can you advise on whether we should request an extension now, and what happens if the loan isn't fully approved by the contingency date?
